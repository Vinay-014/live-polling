# Resilient Live Polling System

A real-time, resilient polling application built for the Intervue.io SDE Intern assignment. This system allows teachers to create polls and students to vote in real-time, handling connection drops and page reloads gracefully.



## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite), TypeScript, CSS Modules (Custom Design System).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.io.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM).
- **Real-time**: Socket.io (Events: `poll:created`, `vote:update`, `timer:sync`).

## Features

### Teacher Persona

- **Create Polls**: Set questions, options, and a timer (e.g., 60s).
- **Live Dashboard**: View real-time participation updates.
- **Poll History**: Review past poll results.
- **Kick Student**: Remove disruptive students from the session.

### Student Persona

- **Interactive Onboarding**: Enter name to join.
- **Live Polling**: Receive questions instantly.
- **Synchronized Timer**: Timer syncs with server; resilience against refreshes.
- **Vote & Results**: Visual feedback on selection and real-time results bar.

### Resilience

- **State Recovery**: Refreshing the page maintains the user's state (Active Poll, Timer, Vote Status).
- **Edge Cases**: Handles late joiners, kicked students, and network reconnection.
